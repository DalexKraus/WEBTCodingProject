                <p>
                    Self driving cars are vehicles that are capable of driving without any human influence or input.
                    <br>They have Sensor that check their environment.<br><br> If there are any obstacles around them,
                    they try to find a way not to hit them.<br> Most self driving cars today are electric cars as well.
                    But whether the vehicle is electric
                    or not, the technique works mostly the same.
                    <br>Electric cars are just more modern than cars with gasoline.<br>
                    <br>But there are also hybrid cars which use both - gasoline and electricity.

            <h3>There are 5 different levels of automation: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Driver assistance: Small assisting things like automatic acceleration or something like this. But:
                    everything is under Human control! </li>
                <li>Partial Automation: This is what some of the Tesla Vehicles have. The car can also automatically
                    take safety actions. But still, a human has to stay alert at the wheel. </li>
                <li>Conditional automation: This level still requires a human driver, but the human is able to put some
                    “safety-critical functions” to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions. But:
                    This poses some safety issues because
                    the human driver passes the major task of driving to or from the car itself. </li>
                <li>High automation: A car that can drive itself almost all the time without any human input, but might
                    be programmed not to drive in unmapped areas or during severe weather. This is a car you could
                    sleep in.</li>
                <li>Full automation: This means full automation in every condition. This does have much less safety
                    issues than any other form of driving. </li>
            </ol>
